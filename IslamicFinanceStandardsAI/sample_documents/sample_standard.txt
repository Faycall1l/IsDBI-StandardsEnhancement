# FAS 4 - Musharaka Financing

## Introduction
This document outlines the accounting principles for Musharaka financing in accordance with Islamic Shariah principles.

## Definitions
**Musharaka**: A partnership contract where all partners contribute capital and share profits and losses according to a pre-agreed ratio.

**Capital**: The money or assets that partners contribute to the partnership.

**Profit**: The increase over capital that is generated from business operations.

**Loss**: The decrease in capital that results from business operations.

## Accounting Treatments
1. **Initial Recognition**: Musharaka financing shall be recognized at the time of disbursement of funds to the partner.

2. **Measurement**: Musharaka financing shall be measured at the amount of funds disbursed less any impairment.

3. **Profit Recognition**: Profits shall be recognized when realized and distributed according to the agreed ratio.

4. **Loss Recognition**: Losses shall be recognized immediately and distributed according to the capital contribution ratio.

## Transaction Structures
### Diminishing Musharaka
1. One partner promises to buy the other partner's share gradually.
2. The buying partner pays rent for using the selling partner's share.
3. The ownership gradually transfers to the buying partner.

### Permanent Musharaka
1. Partners contribute capital to a joint venture.
2. Profits are distributed according to an agreed ratio.
3. Losses are distributed according to capital contribution.
4. The partnership continues indefinitely.

## Ambiguities
- The standard does not clearly define how to account for non-monetary contributions to Musharaka.
- There is ambiguity regarding the treatment of expenses incurred before the Musharaka agreement is finalized.
- The standard does not address how to account for partial withdrawals of capital during the Musharaka term.
