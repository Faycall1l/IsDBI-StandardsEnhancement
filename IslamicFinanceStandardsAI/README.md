# Islamic Finance Standards Enhancement System

A production-ready multi-agent system for enhancing AAOIFI standards through AI-powered review, proposal, and validation with robust error handling, comprehensive monitoring, and detailed audit logging.

## Project Overview

This system uses a sophisticated multi-agent architecture to process, analyze, and enhance Islamic finance standards (AAOIFI FAS and SS documents). The system consists of four primary layers:

1. **Use Case Scenarios (Journal Generator)**
2. **Reverse Transactions (Error Corrector)**
3. **Standards Enhancement** - Current focus with three specialized agents:
   - **Document Ingestion and Parsing Agent**: Extracts structured data from standards documents
   - **Enhancement Agent**: Proposes improvements using chain-of-thought reasoning
   - **Validation and Approval Agent**: Reviews proposals for Shariah compliance
4. **Custom Compliance Advisor**

## Key Features

- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive resilience mechanisms including circuit breakers, retries, and fallbacks
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Detailed performance metrics, health checks, and alerting
- **Immutable Audit Logging**: Simulated Hyperledger Fabric for tamper-evident event tracking
- **Knowledge Graph**: Neo4j database with mock fallback for storing standards, concepts, and principles
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Vector database for accurate information retrieval to reduce hallucinations
- **Claim Verification System**: Automatic verification of factual claims against the knowledge base
- **Production-Ready API**: RESTful endpoints with authentication, rate limiting, and background task processing
- **Comprehensive Testing**: End-to-end test suite with detailed reporting
- **AI-Driven Enhancements**: Chain-of-thought reasoning for generating improvements
- **Shariah Compliance**: Rigorous validation against Islamic finance principles

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.9+ with FastAPI
- **NLP**: OpenAI API, Hugging Face Transformers, SpaCy
- **Knowledge Graph**: Neo4j with fallback mechanisms
- **Vector Database**: FAISS for efficient similarity search in RAG system
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI and Hugging Face embedding models
- **Message Broker**: Simulated Apache Kafka for event streaming
- **Audit Logging**: Simulated Hyperledger Fabric
- **Validation**: Drools rule engine for Shariah compliance
- **Frontend**: React with modern UI components
- **Monitoring**: Custom metrics collection and visualization
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with detailed reporting

## Production Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit the `.env` file with your API keys, database credentials, and configuration settings.

3. Create required directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p logs reports audit_logs sample_documents
   ```

4. Start the production API server:
   ```bash
   python api/api_server.py
   ```

5. In a separate terminal, run the comprehensive test suite:
   ```bash
   python production_test_system.py --verbose
   ```

6. Start the frontend application:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## Architecture

The system follows an event-driven, multi-agent architecture with robust production features:

### Core Components

- **Document Agent**: Processes AAOIFI standards PDFs and extracts structured data
- **Enhancement Agent**: Generates AI-driven improvements using chain-of-thought reasoning
- **Validation Agent**: Reviews proposals against Shariah principles
- **Knowledge Graph**: Neo4j database storing standards, concepts, principles with fallback to mock implementation
- **RAG Engine**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for accurate information retrieval
- **Claim Verifier**: Breaks down responses into verifiable claims and validates them against the knowledge base
- **Audit Logger**: Simulates Hyperledger Fabric for immutable event logging
- **Resilience Module**: Provides circuit breakers, retries, and fallbacks
- **Monitoring System**: Tracks performance metrics and system health
- **API Server**: Exposes functionality through RESTful endpoints

### Data Flow

1. Documents are processed by the Document Agent and stored in both the Knowledge Graph and Vector Database
2. Enhancement Agent analyzes the structured data, retrieves relevant context via RAG, and generates proposals
3. Claim Verifier breaks down proposals into atomic claims and verifies them against the knowledge base
4. Validation Agent reviews proposals for Shariah compliance, factual accuracy, and other criteria
5. All events are logged in the immutable audit log
6. API server exposes the functionality through RESTful endpoints
7. Monitoring system tracks performance and health

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive testing capabilities:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **System Tests**: Test the entire enhancement pipeline
- **Production Tests**: Test the system in a production-like environment

Run the test suite with:

```bash
python production_test_system.py --document /path/to/document.pdf --standard-id 123
```

## Monitoring & Observability

The system provides detailed monitoring and observability features:

- **Health Checks**: `/health` endpoint for system status
- **Metrics**: Performance metrics for all components
- **Audit Logs**: Immutable event logs for all actions
- **Alerts**: Configurable alerting based on metrics

## Security

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for API endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limiting for API endpoints
- **Encryption**: Optional encryption for audit logs
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration stored in environment variables
