FAS 4 - Musharaka Financing

Definition:
Musharaka is a partnership between two or more parties where each partner contributes capital and participates in the work.

Accounting Treatments:
1. Initial Recognition: The partner's share in Musharaka capital should be recognized when payment is made or when capital is placed at the disposal of the Musharaka venture.
2. Subsequent Measurement: The partner's share is measured at the end of the financial period at historical cost after accounting for any profit or loss.
3. Profit Distribution: Profits are distributed according to the agreed ratio, while losses are distributed according to the capital contribution ratio.

Transaction Structures:
1. Diminishing Musharaka: A form of partnership where one partner gradually purchases the other partner's share over time.
2. Constant Musharaka: A partnership where the partners' shares remain constant throughout the duration of the venture.

Ambiguities:
1. The standard does not clearly specify the treatment of losses in case of negligence.
2. There is ambiguity in the profit distribution mechanism when one partner contributes both capital and labor.
3. The standard lacks clarity on the valuation of non-monetary assets contributed as capital.
4. The termination procedures in case of partner default are not well-defined.
